! Error handling in the plugin helpers was broken
* Workaround non-working + interface wildcard in nftables's iptables binary

+ Added LAN to LAN (Inter-LAN) filtering rules, LAN_LAN_HOST_OPEN_xxx, Issue #28
- Removed unused INT_FORWARD_IN_CHAIN and INT_FORWARD_OUT_CHAIN user chains, related to Issue #28
  Note: Any custom rule or plugin should generally use the FORWARD_CHAIN or POST_FORWARD_CHAIN to access the FORWARD chain.
        Additionally, the new LAN_LAN_HOST_OPEN_xxx rules natively handle Inter-LAN filtering.
* New support for ICMPv6 Multicast Listener Discovery, enable with OPEN_ICMPV6_MLD=1, disabled by default

* traffic-shaper plugin, allow DOWNLINK=0 to disable inbound (ingress) shaping
* Updated Gentoo init script (thanks to Erki Ferenc)
- Removed some Gentoo specific stuff that isn't required anymore
- Removed TRACE option. It's broken and there's no good way to implement it
+ Added DMZ_INPUT_DENY_LOG variable support for default "AIF:DMZ-INPUT denied:" logs, "0" disables logs

----------------------------------
+ Reintroduce DNS fast fail option + add additional option (DNS_FAST_FAIL_ONCE) to allow plugins to use it
+ Added nat-loopback plugin for local nets using existing NAT_FORWARD_TCP and NAT_FORWARD_UDP rules.
+ Added new main command 'status-plugins [name]'.  Useful [name] values are: dyndns-host-open, multiroute, nat-loopback,
  rpc, traffic-accounting and traffic-shaper.  When [name] is specified, only that plugin is shown.
  For Example:
    $ arno-iptables-firewall status-plugins                       (shows all plugins status results)
    $ arno-iptables-firewall status-plugins dyndns-host-open      (shows only dyndns-host-open plugin status results)
+ Added outbound-snat plugin to support when a NAT'ed external interface has multiple IPv4 addresses, it may be
  desirable to specify which internal IP's or CIDR's use which external IPv4 addresses for outbound connections.
! Fixed modprobe() function when using kmod. Apparently kmod doesn't echo anything (to stderr) when a module is not found?!
! Fix logging dropped packets matching (ie, not just TCP) for LAN_INET_FORWARD_CHAIN and DMZ_INET_FORWARD_CHAIN.
+ Added new variables LAN_INET_DEFAULT_POLICY_DROP, DMZ_INET_DEFAULT_POLICY_DROP and LAN_DEFAULT_POLICY_DROP
  to define the default policies. When undefined the 'automatic' policy is the default as with all previous versions.
* Allow plugins to maintain a dynamic chain (e.g. MINIUPNPD) in the nat table and not get automatically flushed on a restart.
* Improved traffic-accounting & dyndns-host-open plugins with a new host cache mechanism

Version 2.0.1c (June 27, 2012)
------------------------------
! Fix a script 'IFS' issue if IPv6 and DMZ is enabled together with DMZ_HOST_OPEN_IP (thanks to Ingmar Schraub)

! Removed stray line in install.sh
* Updated/corrected documentation

Version 2.0.1a (March 7, 2012)
------------------------------
* Misc. tweaks for arno-fwfilter (thanks Mark van Dijk)
* Use ls instead of [ -n (find) ] as it's much faster (thanks Lonnie)
* As with previous versions, when LAN_INET_OPEN_xxx and LAN_INET_HOST_OPEN_xxx are NOT defined
  the default LAN->INET policy is ACCEPT. Changed is when *any* of these variables are defined
  the default LAN->INET policy is DROP for all ports and protocols, not just TCP/UDP/IP as before.
* As with previous versions, when DMZ_INET_OPEN_xxx and DMZ_INET_HOST_OPEN_xxx are NOT defined
  the default DMZ->INET policy is ACCEPT. Changed is when *any* of these variables are defined
  the default DMZ->INET policy is DROP for all ports and protocols, not just TCP/UDP/IP as before.
* Tweak the handling of some of the sysctl kernel settings. This now also
  allows disabling setting/resetting some settings (like forwarding)
* Default UDP connection timeout to 60 seconds
+ Added support for new LOCAL_CONFIG_DIR variable, defaults to "/etc/arno-iptables-firewall/conf.d" (Debian bug #658458)
! Set default policy to DROP if either LAN_INET_HOST_OPEN_xxx or DMZ_INET_HOST_OPEN_xxx are defined,
  to match the documentation. (thanks Schilling Thomas Ing for reporting)
* Improve documentation

Version 2.0.1 (December 18, 2011)
---------------------------------
- Removed DNS_FAST_FAIL & RESOLV_IPS since they are both obsolete
* Few changes in the install/uninstall scripts. eg. arno-fwfilter now installs to /usr/local/bin instead

Version 2.0.1-BETA1 (October 10, 2011)
--------------------------------------
! Fixed kernel_ver_chk() function to properly handle kernel 3. (thanks Gunawan Lim for reporting)
! Fixed variables containing REJECT_UDP with IPv6 enabled, it should use 'icmp6-addr-unreachable' for IPv6.
* Updated "DynDNS Host Open" and "DMZ-DNAT" plugins to use new parse_rule() function.
* AIF variables are now parsed with a common function, now missing fields are logged with a warning.
* Misc. tweaks

Version 2.0.0c (July 28, 2011)
-----------------------------------
* Call insserv during configure, when available. This is required for eg.
  Debian/Ubuntu systems that use dependency based booting
! Fixed MULTICAST jumping should be done at the end of the EXT_INPUT_CHAIN, not
  at the beginning else users won't be able create "normal" rules for it
* Updated several plugins
* Several tweaks

Version 2.0.0b (March 25, 2011)
-------------------------------
+ Perform kernel check when IPv6 support is enabled
- Don't auto detect external interface settings during configure. It's too
  confusing and fills out the wrong values for certain setups (like laptops that are moved around)
+ Show platform information on start/restart when verbose
! remove bash-ism related to traffic-shaper plugin (Reported by Debian upstream, Debian bug #619496)
! remove bash-ism in ipsec-vpn plugin (Reported by Debian upstream, Debian bug #617510)
! workaround Busybox 'ash' bug when IPV6_SUPPORT is enabled
+ Added pptp-vpn plugin for local PPTP server support
! arno-fwfilter uses incorrect URL for location lookup (Debian bug #613631, thanks to Tony Evans for the patch)

! Fixed handling HOST_OPEN_ICMP, HOST_DENY_ICMP_NOLOG and HOST_DENY_ICMP variables
  with IPv6 addresses. (thanks Klemen Mihevc)
* Tweaked NAT module loading + cosmetics. iptable_nat is a required module for
  AIF because of the plugin framework/helper chains so it's wrong to only load
  it when NAT is enabled in the main script.

Version 2.0.0a (December 30, 2010)
----------------------------------------
! Set IFS=' ' in our batch-functions else the wrappers fail in some cases
- Removed old legacy plugin support that used the PLUGIN_PATH variable
! Fixed an issue when the value of IPV6_SUPPORT was changed then followed with a 'restart'
* (Cosmetic) tweaks

Version 2.0.0 (November 15, 2010)
---------------------------------
! dig wrapper using nslookup, extract IPv4 addresses over IPv6 addresses
* ipsec-vpn plugin, removed unnecessary EXT_INPUT_CHAIN rule and added IPv6 support
  for matching AH headers

Version 1.9.9-RC1 (October 25, 2010)
------------------------------------
- Removed deprecated check_binary() function from environment
+ Added support for an optional plugin_restart() function in plugins using a new plugin template,
  while supporting previous plugins without a plugin_restart() function
* Refactor load_modules() using our new modprobe_multi() 
* Allow modprobe_multi() function arguments to be grouped by a comma
+ Use IDENT environment variable for plugins
+ Added SHAPER_IF variable to traffic-shaper plugin to specify a single external interface
  should the default EXT_IF value contain more than one interface
+ Added SIP_VOIP_REMOTE_HOSTS variable to sip-voip plugin to limit access by source address
- Removed obsolete module_probe() function. Use modprobe() instead
+ Added IPV6_AUTO_CONFIGURATION variable to control autoconf when IP_FORWARDING = 0
+ Added IPV6_OVER_IPV4_SERVER variable for ipv6-over-ipv4 plugin, restricting 6to4 source packets
* Misc. tweaks & fixes

Version 1.9.9-BETA1 (October 8, 2010)
-------------------------------------
* Refactor setting kernel parameters
! Revert change that didn't masquerade IPv6/proto 41, so outgoing forwarded connections work properly
+ Added EXTERNAL_DHCPV6_SERVER variable to allow DHCPv6 clients on the *external* interface
* The default INET->DMZ policy is now DROP.  Common variables this change may effect are:
  INET_DMZ_HOST_OPEN_xxx and INET_DMZ_OPEN_xxx
+ Added support for Link-Local-Multicast ICMPv6 echo-request packets
+ Added LINK_LOCAL_DROP_LOG variable which controls logging of dropped IPv6 Link-Local addresses.
+ Added FORWARD_LINK_LOCAL variable which, by default (0), disables forwarding of IPv6 Link-Local addresses.
+ Added EXT_MULTICAST_CHAIN to handle external-inbound multicast traffic
+ Added DHCPv6 support for the EXT_IF_DHCP_IP variable.
+ Added a new variable FORWARD_DROP_LOG to disable logging dropped forwards when set to 0, defaults to 1.
! Fixed handling of destination host~port fields where only the host was specified.
+ Added a new set of variables INET_FORWARD_xxx to allow forwarding INET IPv6 and non-NAT'ed IPv4 packets
  to other interfaces.  The format is similar to the IPv4 NAT_FORWARD_xxx without port mapping.
+ Added a new variable OPEN_ICMPV6 to allow independent control of INET ICMP for IPv4 and IPv6, enabled by default.
! Fixed handling of INET_DMZ_HOST_OPEN_xxx variables
! Fixed handling of INET_DMZ_HOST_DENY_xxx variables
! Fixed handling of INET_DMZ_DENY_TCP
! Fixed variable typo, INET_DMZ_HOST_DENY_TCP was not handled
+ Added IPv6 reserved network support, label logs by IPv4 and IPv6
! Fixed RESERVED_NET_LOG is now independant from DROP_PRIVATE_ADDRESSES
+ Added option to the configure script to enable/disable IPv6 + several tweaks
* Sanity check should always be the first thing we do since we probably can't
  write the log-file in case we're not root
+ Automatically disable IPV6_SUPPORT if IPv6 is not detected in the kernel
+ Add support for mixed IPv4/IPv6 when IPV6_SUPPORT=1
